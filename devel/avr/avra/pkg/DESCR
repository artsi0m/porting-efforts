AVRA is an assembler for Atmel AVR microcontrollers, and it is almost
compatible with Atmel's own assembler, AVRASM32. AVRA is written in
C99.There are some differences between the original Atmel assembler
AVRASM32 and AVRA. Basically, AVRA is designed to replace AVRASM32
without special changes in your current Atmel AVR Studio
enviroment. Command line options have been adapted as far as
possible. Jumping to fault-containing lines directly by
double-clicking on the error message in the output window does work as
with AVRASM32.
